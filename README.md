# crop-yield-prediction

Developed a machine learning model to accurately predict crop yields based on key agricultural and environmental parameters such as rainfall, temperature, soil type, humidity, and pH levels. Implemented using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, the system uses a Random Forest Regressor to model complex non-linear relationships within the data. The model achieved high accuracy (RÂ² > 0.90) on test data and provided insights into feature importance, helping identify which factors most impact crop output. The project supports data-driven agricultural planning, enabling smarter decision-making for farmers and policymakers. Future scope includes deploying the model via a web-based interface for real-time predictions.
