# crop-yield-prediction

Developed a machine learning model to accurately predict crop yields based on key agricultural and environmental parameters such as rainfall, temperature, soil type, humidity, and pH levels. Implemented using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, the system uses a Random Forest Regressor to model complex non-linear relationships within the data. The model achieved high accuracy (R² > 0.90) on test data and provided insights into feature importance, helping identify which factors most impact crop output. The project supports data-driven agricultural planning, enabling smarter decision-making for farmers and policymakers. Future scope includes deploying the model via a web-based interface for real-time predictions.
To enhance agricultural efficiency and sustainability, this project leverages historical yield data combined with weather and soil metrics to forecast future crop production. The workflow included extensive data preprocessing, feature selection, and outlier handling to ensure model robustness. A comparative study with other regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, SVR) confirmed Random Forest’s superior performance in capturing data complexity. Visualizations were integrated to interpret model behavior and support explainability. The system can assist in yield estimation under climate variability, optimize resource allocation, and potentially integrate with IoT sensors for real-time farm monitoring in future iterations.
